# 1 to start the server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

# 2 install the following:
```bash
npm install typescript cors dotenv express ts-node ts-node-dev

npx tsc --init

npm install --save-dev @types/cors
npm install --save-dev @types/express
npm install --save-dev @types/node
npm install --save-dev nodemon
npm install --save-dev typescript
npm install --save-dev @types/ip
npm install --save-dev @types/cookie-parser
npm install --save-dev @types/jsonwebtoken
```


# 3 server is running on the port below:
```bash
server is listening on 192.168.96.1:8080
```


# 4 Find Your Server's IP Address

***If you're using a local development server (e.g., running localhost), you need to find your public IP address.***

Run this command in your terminal or command prompt to find public IP:

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```
# 5 public IP vs local network IP:
curl ifconfig.me (105.112.218.99) → This is your public IP (the one exposed to the internet).
while:
ip.address() (192.168.96.1) → This is your local network IP (used within your local network).

# 6 localhost vs local network IP:
If you are running your React Native app on the web (instead of Expo Go on a physical phone), then you can use http://localhost:5000 just like in your other React Native app, task manger.

# 7 When Can You Use localhost?
✅ React Native Web (npm run web or expo start --web)
✅ React App running in the same browser as the backend
✅ Both frontend and backend are running on the same machine

When Do You Need 192.168.x.x Instead?
❌ When using Expo Go on a physical phone
❌ When testing on an emulator/device that is not the same machine as the backend

# A discovery:
i kept getting:response from backend: Network request failed when trying to reach my backend via this code:
```js
const googleBookAPIResponse = await GoogleBooksAPI(
          extractedText40
        );
```
in my CameraScreen.tsx file. The i noticed that my expo is running on  Metro waiting on exp://192.168.43.52:8081 and for the web: Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081. While my backend is listening on:
```bash
server is listening on 192.168.96.1:8080
```
192.168.96.1 seems to be related to WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), which isnt needed for this setup.


***How to Find the Correct IP for Fetch***
Run this command in your terminal:
```bash
ipconfig # On Windows
ifconfig # On macOS/Linux
```
***Understanding Your Network Setup***
From your ipconfig output, you have two network interfaces with different IPs:

Wi-Fi Adapter (192.168.43.52) → This is the IP used by Expo Go (your phone is on this network). ✅
WSL Virtual Network (192.168.96.1) → This is a virtual network created by Windows (likely from WSL or Hyper-V). 🚨 Not the right IP!
💡 Your server is running on 192.168.96.1, which is isolated inside a virtual network. Your phone (Expo Go) is on 192.168.43.x, so it can't reach the backend.

#  Fix: Bind Backend to Your Wi-Fi IP (192.168.43.52)
Modify your backend to listen on your actual Wi-Fi IP (192.168.43.52) instead of 192.168.96.1:

🛠 Change in index.js (or server.ts)
```js
const port = Number(process.env.PORT) || 8080;
const HOST = "192.168.43.52"; // Set this to your Wi-Fi IP

app.listen(port, HOST, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on http://${HOST}:${port}`);
});
```
or 
***Alternative: Use 0.0.0.0 Instead***
If you want the server to be accessible from all network interfaces, use 0.0.0.0:

```js
const HOST = "0.0.0.0"; // Accept requests from any IP
```
This will bind to all available IPs, but in the logs, you'll still see something like:

```bash
Server is listening on 192.168.96.1:8080
```

Now, change the fetch() request in api.ts to use 192.168.43.52:8080:

# Summary nof discovery:

👉The backend is on the wrong IP (192.168.96.1 is isolated).
👉Switch to 192.168.43.52 (your Wi-Fi network).
👉Update the frontend fetch() request.
👉Restart both server & Expo.
This should fix the issue!
